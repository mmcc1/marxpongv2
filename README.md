Pong Driven By Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network

Marx Pong v2 is meant as an example of how to drive a control system with a neural network trained by genetic algorithm.  

The AI can be found in MarxPong_AI.cs under the AI folder, the rest of the program merely renders Pong.

On the windows form, select the 'Control' menu and select 'Play' to start training.  This will spin off a thread in the background and the main screen will be updated with statistics and a snapshot of the game of progress.
